                        Plenty of issues at Stericycle Garland that I feel need to be addressed. I have been left with
                        reaching the conclusion that between Gus Gamez , Rey Garza and Karol Reyes collusion has
                        occurred with the intent to terminate my employment at Stericycle. It was due to the reason that
                        I stood up for what is right and did not stand for the illegal activity at the facility. I
                        pretty much became a nuisance when I started calling our ethics point division as far any
                        complaint I had. Reason I called the ethics point was because after speaking to supervisiors
                        Carmen Enriquez, Joe Peralta , Matt Boren , Lisa Henery and Gus Gamez, none of my concerns were
                        being handled. I do believe I followed protocol and calling our ethics hotline would be my last
                        resort.
                        However, when it came to illegal, safety and racist concerns I strongly feel that Rey
                        Garza, Karol Reyes and Gus Gamez they gathered up some excuses and covered up their tracks to
                        make me believe as if I am just making things up.

                        *Due to some managers not being qualified to do a Re-Route we had way too many issues
                        Truck capacity issues ensued, we were packing out, leading us to incomplete routes. Since we
                        could not finish routes, they were being spread all over to other drivers which was a domino
                        effect of not finishing routes for future days. I’m sure we had plenty of complaints to customer
                        service. This caused warehouse not to have our trucks ready overnight meaning we would have
                        delayed starts. Instead of me starting my route at 5am now I’m starting at 8 -10am meaning I’m
                        not getting home till 8 maybe 9 pm. Gus Gamez oversaw all of this, but yet is not doing anything
                        to fix it. I am just a regular route driver all it took was for me to call ethics division on
                        12/14/2018 and within a week this problem was fixed.

                        I was assigned to drive a truck that I’m clearly not licensed to drive it was way over the
                        26,001 pounds, but me and several other drivers were driving this truck. As class C drivers we
                        are not trained to find the weight of a truck to see if we can drive it. Gus claims that we were
                        trained on this on plenty of occasions but ask anyone at stericycle and they will tell you our
                        pre-trip does not include check the weight of the truck. Since we did not have enough trucks our
                        supervisiors allowed us to drive trucks illegaly to complete routes. One of our drivers was
                        pulled over driving this truck so all of this is on paper trail. All managers oversaw this.

                        Since none of our supervisors and management carefully planned how to get new trucks, we ended
                        up with some trucks not legal to transport waste. We were driving trucks that did not have the
                        equipment built in to safely secure biohazard medical waste. In a few instances we had trucks
                        without proper floors and walls. The trucks had raw wood meaning that this violates RULE 326.53
                        stating (iv)all trucks must have a floor and sides made of an impervious, nonporous material. I
                        also have attached photos. I was assigned these trucks for the next two weeks after addressing
                        my concern management did nothing about this. In an attached photo you can see even my truck
                        report log was crossed out by Gus Gamez. After I contacted ethics point about trucks being
                        illegal these all the not legal trucks were replaced immediately. After I brought this up to
                        Ray, Karol and Gus they claim that we never had these trucks, but I kept photos and videos of
                        these trucks. Once again why is this stuff going on with Gus overseeing transportation.

                        In mid -January there is a driver that claimed he was going to retire and his route is one that
                        some drivers including me would have loved to have the opportunity to get due to it having
                        Fridays off. Without posting the position to the board the position was given to Tim Miller not
                        officially. Reason it was given to Tim is because Lisa Henery assigns the routes and Tim Miller
                        has not shown that he is the most qualified for this position. Tim was taken off his usual route
                        so he can just replace the retiring driver when he decides to retire, he was even starting to
                        take Fridays off as well. While there is other routes needing to be completed instead they stick
                        Tim to ride along and take it easy on the passenger seat. After I called ethics point, I was
                        contacted by Karol, Rey and Gus and they informed me that none of this was going and I’m just
                        reaching my own conclusions on just hearsay. So, I’m only left to conclude that this was their
                        only defense because if they admit that Tim was given the position, I can easily file something
                        with EEOC. So, they had to protect themselves and come up with something to keep me from
                        pursuing this.
                        If someone can investigate this, you can see where all my facts will align. Clock in times maybe
                        interview some drivers.

                        Now I get called in to the office for being late even though my time changed from 6am to 530am
                        so I was considered late. I told them what happened, and they still wrote me up. However, when
                        time changes from 530 to 6am they want me to sit there and not clock in till 6 am. I contacted
                        ethics on this, and Karol Rey and Gus just brushed it off. It seems that Karol Rey and Gus
                        intercept all my ethics complaints.
                        Ask stericycle garland if our start times change and you will see that this is not right.

                            After these incidents I realized that Rey Karol Gus are here protecting themselves. I
                            decided to go over to the TCEQ and DOT and report the illegal activities that stericycle
                            garland has done. TCEQ did inform me if I ever see them doing illegal stuff to call their
                            Fort Worth office and they will come and cite the location. I’m not sure if they were
                            contacted by any of them but i made sure to let them know it was me that had called. Soon
                            after this happened I have constantly been getting taken to the office for any reason. I
                            have been written up twice for being late and one of those occurred by constant start time
                            change. It’s obvious that they are working to get me fired.<br>
                            <br>
                            On April 12 I was taken to office because I’m supposedly not acting professionally they
                            claim 2 co-workers have filed complaints on me and I can assure you that I rarely speak to
                            any co-workers.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            April 25 I was terminated due to attendance and misconduct at a customer location.
                            In 5 years I have never called in that I’m not going to work much less been disciplined for
                            misconduct at a customer location.
                            <br><br>
                            I have been late and I still had 3 chances for being late to be terminated.
                            It is obvious that having me working at stericycle will make them have to walk a tight rope.
                            All they had to do was do the right thing, when there’s an employee concern. Some small
                            concerns were addressed but when it comes to the big ones, they seem to turn the other way
                            and make is seem like I’m just seeing things. I’m hoping that there can be some kind of
                            investigation because I feel that I did do the right thing. I have no regrets for not
                            wanting to do illegal stuff. I strongly feel that Gus Gamez is not qualified for his
                            position. It might have cost me my job but stericylce did save a few lawsuits by firing me
                            because I stood up for what is right. Another thing that also bothered me is how Karol Reyes
                            during a conference call insinuated that I should quit my job because I sounded unhappy. Joe
                            Peralta also insinuated I should quit my job. Those were the days I felt the lowest about
                            working for Stericycle.
                            <br><br>

                            … I was approved for unemployment benefits which further shows that I was fired for a no
                            good reason. Which also makes me lean to the fact that I was retaliated against for making
                            reports to our
                            Ethics hotline.
                            The TWC told me I was fired for “being rude” at a customer location. The way
                            our local stericycle handles these situations is by having a different driver handle that
                            specific stop that complained on the driver. I have had to cover for Tim Miller because
                            labcorp claims he is rude. Reggie Turner has a sexual harrassment complaint from a customer,
                            but me I had a single “being rude” complain and took a whole month to fire me for that. This
                            is very fishy and unprofessional.

                                    I really need this explained to me. Why did Gus Gamez cross out my concern
                                    this seems to violate DOT rules. I mean he is altering a report.
                                    After sending these photos to Rey Garza(district manager) he tells me "what do
                                    you want me to do with this?." Which led to me to believe that he's just brushing

                                it will solely fall on me not the company. This dictates what Joe Peralta told me.
                                He also stated that if these trucks are back at stericycle to call him and stericycle

                                Which further makes me believe that I got retaliated against for making reports to

                                       In October 2018 I enrolled to SMU Global and Online for Web Development. I took advantage
                                       of the tuition reimbursment with stericycle to become a Jr. Developer for the company. On 3-26-2019
                                       I was approved for the +5000 grant from stericycle. I had no intentions for leaving stericycle just my 
                                       luck that I felt comfortable when I read that stericycle does not tolerate against anyone making reports.

                                             Gus, Karol and Rey completely took advantage of their positions
